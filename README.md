CORNE 42 COLUMN KEYMAPS

First keyboard build!!!

Sometimes typing on a standard keyboard can be a bit cumbersome 
due to the finger gymnastics required to hit all the symbol keys
This is greatly exacerbated now that I am learning Rust, but C++ gives similar strain when dealing with templates.
Spent days trying to come up with an optimal layout for the symbols and numbers, 
and colemak-dh was chosen for the alpha keys because of rave reviews and
the desire for an optimal ergonomic experience.

layout - colemak-dh but with semicolon/colon moved down, and quotes instead of fwd-slash/question-mark

3 layers, ALPHA keys, SYMBOLS/NUMBERS, and FUNCTION keys

outer columns unused as I am considering modifying the board to be a 36 layout

makes liberal use of hold/tap behavior on the thumb keys, none on the main keys as I get nitpicky on latency
