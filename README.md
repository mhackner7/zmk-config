CORNE 42 COLUMN KEYMAPS

First keyboard build!!!

Sometimes typing on a standard keyboard can be a bit cumbersome 
due to the finger gymnastics required to hit all the symbol keys
This is greatly exacerbated now that I am learning Rust, but C++ gives similar strain when dealing with templates.
Spent days trying to come up with an optimal layout for the symbols and numbers, 
and colemak-dh was chosen for the alpha keys because of rave reviews and
the desire for an optimal ergonomic experience.

layout - colemak-dh but with semicolon/colon moved down, and quotes instead of fwd-slash/question-mark

3 layers, ALPHA keys, SYMBOLS/NUMBERS, and FUNCTION keys

outer columns unused as I am considering modifying the board to be a 36 layout

makes liberal use of hold/tap behavior on the thumb keys, none on the main keys as I get nitpicky on latency

Rust, C/C++, Typescript, and C# all frequently use the semicolon, so I wanted to keep it for the quickest access;

The most natural feeling way to have the numbers accessible while still leaving room for the symbols. I prefer snake case, so underscore had to  be the easiest to access. Parenthesis, Brace, and math operations also had to be no more than one key away.

Since each layer has the needed keys and modifiers (focused on Hyprland, Neovim/Helix, Kitty, and Arch shortcuts) all I needed here was the function keys, arrow keys, and bluetooth selector keys for the keyboard itself.
